# ObjectDetection-Neural-Network
This project is based on the classification of the object using the pretrained model of VGG16 and reset50 ,that is correctly able to predict many test images with 60% efficiency,i trained the model for
40 epochs and due to lack of training data and much computing power the model couldn't be trainedd further.It gave an efficient result for many 
objects but failed for 2-3 objects
